# Retail Track

    This is a Fall 2023 COP3530 final project at the University of Florida. Our team consists of members Cody Flynn, Alex Garcia-Marin, and Han Mach.

    Our goal in this project is to create a comprehensive solution for small businesses dealing with inventory management and sales tracking. We aim to develop a robust application that integrates various selling platforms, ultimately enabling businesses to efficiently track their stock movements, sales data, and other insights in one place.

    We have used various APIs provided by selling platforms, along with database management systems coupled with Python to create a user-friendly interface for managing inventory, assess profit margins, and maintain expense records.

    Through this project we hope to help small businesses with a tool that streamlines often hard-to-manage processes and foster more informed business practices.
